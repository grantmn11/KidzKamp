    <br>
  <p class="card-text" style='font-family: Roboto Mono, ; font-size: 18px;'>Since 1996, Doyle Park Kidz Kamp has been ingrained in the fabric of the Doyle Elementary School community and neighborhood at large. We provide high quality, active-based after school childcare for Doyle Elementary students during the school year and transition to a day camp open to all school-age children during school breaks including Thanksgiving Break, Winter Break, Spring Break, and Summer Break. Our quality of care is maintained through a highly qualified staff, communication and involvement within the community, consistent adherence to child safety protocols, and purposeful daily planning of activities. We offer year-round youth programs upholding a high standard, maintaining our core values and following all safety protocols is the top priority. Our afterschool program offers daily structured games, arts and crafts, homework help and snack. During the summer and holiday break camps we are open from 7:30am to 6:00pm offering a full day of care. Daily structured games, arts and crafts, reading and school work help and snack are all provided during these programs. Our summer program includes weekly field trips, all of which are local and in safe and controlled establishments.  </p>
